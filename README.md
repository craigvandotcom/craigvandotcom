**AI Agentic Engineer** | Amsterdam | Open to opportunities

I build production AI agent systems — multi-agent coordination, tool ecosystems, and autonomous development workflows. I apply [Kieran Klaassen's Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) and [Jeffrey Emanuel's Agentic Coding Flywheel](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffreyEmanuel) to ship real products with AI agents.

## Agentic Engineering System (PAI)

The infrastructure I built to develop everything below:

- **Swarm orchestration** — spawn N parallel AI agents in tmux sessions, coordinate through file reservations and structured messaging
- **6-step flywheel** — architect > gatekeeper review > Ralph loop (implement + test until acceptance criteria met) > code review > deploy > land the plane. Plans routinely 5,000+ lines, broken into atomic task specs (beads)
- **24 CLI tools** — all with `--json` output for agent consumption: Gmail, Calendar, Tasks, Discord, Notion, YouTube, image generation, TTS, web scraping
- **3-tier context system** — progressive disclosure across 17 domain skills, cutting token waste by 60%+
- **Automated plan refinement** — send architectural plans to 3-4 AI models in parallel, synthesize feedback, iterate until convergence
- **[Expert Consensus](https://github.com/craigvandotcom/agent-compounds)** — open-source multi-model synthesis tool. Fan out one prompt to 9 flagship AI models, get one synthesized answer. Configurable panel via `panel.json`.

## Health Product Suite

Four apps, all built using the agentic workflows above:

| App | What it does | Stack |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Body Compass** | Health tracking with AI-powered food analysis. 65+ components, Jest + Playwright E2E tests. Production-ready. | Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, Capacitor iOS |
| **Unsit Your Back** | Spinal health and posture correction. Multi-agent code review workflows, design system, automated browser testing. | Next.js, TypeScript, Radix UI, Playwright |
| **Freedom of Movement** | Movement education platform. 12-week progressive course structure, exercise prescription system. Built on my Biokinetics background. | Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase |
| **Art of Stillness** | Meditation and breathwork practice. Guided session engine, progress tracking. | Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase |

## Background

**MSc Data Science** — Tilburg University. Thesis: exercise supervision with pose estimation (MoveNet).

**BSc Hons Biokinetics** — University of the Witwatersrand. Clinical exercise science — the domain knowledge behind the health apps.

**Adyen** — Technical Support Engineer. Payment terminal integrations, API debugging, network trace analysis. Production systems where failures have real consequences.

**Self-taught engineering** — CS50 (Harvard), Data Engineering with Python (DataCamp). Then built everything above.
