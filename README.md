**AI Agentic Engineer** | Amsterdam

I study and apply agentic engineering frameworks — [Kieran Klaassen's Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) and [Jeffrey Emanuel's Agentic Coding Flywheel](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffreyEmanuel) — to build real products with multi-agent workflows.

## What I'm Building

### Health Product Suite
Four apps, all built using agentic development workflows:

**Body Compass** — Health tracking app with AI-powered food analysis. Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, Capacitor iOS. 65+ components, Jest + Playwright E2E tests. Production-ready.

**Unsit Your Back** — Spinal health and posture correction app. Full `.claude/` skill system with design system, browser testing, planning, and multi-agent code review workflows.

**Freedom of Movement** — Movement education platform based on my Biokinetics background. 12-week progressive course structure, exercise prescription system, session templates.

**Art of Stillness** — Meditation and mindfulness practice app. Completing the health systems suite: eat, move, meditate.

### Agentic Engineering System (PAI)
The infrastructure I built to develop all of the above:

- **Swarm orchestration** — spawn N parallel AI agents in tmux sessions, coordinate work through file reservations (based on Kieran's compound engineering patterns)
- **6-step flywheel** — architect > gatekeeper review > Ralph loop (implement + test until acceptance criteria met) > code review > deploy > land the plane. Adapted from Jeffrey Emanuel's methodology — plans routinely 5,000+ lines, beads (atomic task specs) so clear an intern could implement them.
- **Automated plan refinement** — send plans to 3-4 AI models in parallel, synthesize feedback, iterate until convergence
- **24 CLI tools** — all with `--json` output for agent consumption. Gmail, Calendar, Tasks, Discord, Notion, YouTube, image generation, TTS, web scraping
- **3-tier context system** — progressive disclosure architecture across 17 domain skills, cutting token waste by 60%+

## What I Care About

Applying agentic engineering frameworks to ship real products faster and better. Not AI theory — AI systems that coordinate, build, and deploy. The craft of turning multi-agent workflows into working software.
