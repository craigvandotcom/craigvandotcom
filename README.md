**AI Agentic Engineer** | Amsterdam

I study and apply agentic engineering frameworks — [Kieran Klaassen's Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) and [Jeffrey Emanuel's Agentic Coding Flywheel](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffreyEmanuel) — to build real products with multi-agent workflows.

## What I'm Building

### Health Product Suite
Four apps, all built using agentic development workflows:

**[Body Compass](https://github.com/craigvandotcom/body-compass-app)** — Health tracking app with AI-powered food analysis. Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, Capacitor iOS. 65+ components, Jest + Playwright E2E tests. The most mature project — production-ready.

**Unsit Your Back** — Spinal health and posture correction app. Full `.claude/` skill system with design system, browser testing, planning, and multi-agent code review workflows.

**Freedom of Movement** — Movement education platform based on my Biokinetics background. 12-week progressive course structure, exercise prescription system, session templates.

**Art of Stillness** — Meditation and mindfulness practice app. Completing the health systems triptych: eat, move, meditate.

### Agentic Engineering System (PAI)
The infrastructure I built to develop all of the above:

- **Swarm orchestration** — spawn N parallel AI agents in tmux sessions, coordinate work through task management and file reservations (based on Kieran's compound engineering patterns)
- **8-step flywheel** — idea > plan > refine > beadify > execute > review > commit (adapted from Jeffrey Emanuel's methodology). Plans routinely 5,000+ lines — more detailed than the final code.
- **Automated plan refinement** — send plans to 3-4 AI models in parallel, synthesize feedback, iterate until convergence
- **24 CLI tools** — all with `--json` output for agent consumption. Gmail, Calendar, Tasks, Discord, Notion, YouTube, image generation, TTS, web scraping
- **3-tier context system** — progressive disclosure architecture across 17 domain skills, cutting token waste by 60%+
- **Beads task system** — atomic work units with graph-theory prioritization, designed for agent consumption (Rust CLI)

### Content Automation Pipeline
End-to-end publishing: YouTube research + packaging, newsletter generation, X/Twitter thread creation. AI agents handle research, drafting, and scheduling — I review and publish.

`Python` `Typefully API` `MailerLite` `YouTube API`

## Infrastructure

- **PM2-managed services** — Telegram bot (mobile control center), custom scheduler (APScheduler), background services. Auto-restart, memory limits, health checks.
- **Cross-machine deployment** — Mac + Linux VM, portable configs, SSH key auth
- **Dual scheduler** — native cron for system tasks + custom APScheduler for AI-driven jobs

## Background

- MSc Data Science (Tilburg University)
- BSc Hons Biokinetics (University of the Witwatersrand)
- Technical Support Engineer at Adyen (payment systems, API debugging)
- CS50 (Harvard), Data Engineering with Python (DataCamp)

## What I Care About

Applying agentic engineering frameworks to ship real products faster and better. Not AI theory — AI systems that coordinate, build, and deploy. The craft of turning multi-agent workflows into working software.
